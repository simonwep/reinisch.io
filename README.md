### The source-code doesn't seem to fit the current homepage?

That's correct! This repository represents a significant milestone in my programming journey - my first portfolio website created in 2020.
I decided it was time for a complete redesign and rebuilt my homepage from scratch.

Rather than removing this repository, I've chosen to preserve it as a legacy project.

### Why isn't the current homepage open source anymore?

I remain a passionate advocate for open source software - as evidenced by the fact that virtually all my projects (like [Ocular](https://github.com/simonwep/ocular), [Viselect](https://github.com/simonwep/viselect), [Nanopop](https://github.com/simonwep/nanopop), and others) are fully open source
and freely available for all to use, modify, and learn from.

However, as professional demands have increased over time, I've had to make practical decisions about where to invest my limited development hours.
For my personal portfolio, I chose to keep the codebase private, so I could focus exclusively on the end result rather than maintaining the additional overhead that comes with properly documented,
well-structured open source code.

This decision allows me to iterate quickly on my personal site while still dedicating quality time to maintaining and improving my public open source projects, which have much
broader impact and usage throughout the developer community.

You can check out my new homepage at [reinisch.io](https://reinisch.io)!
However, you can still check out my legacy homepage at [legacy.reinisch.io](https://legacy.reinisch.io) :)
